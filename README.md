# Would you rather

This is a React + Redux application I build for online polling also known as "would you rather".


It helps a start-up in the field of pixel art to conduct online polling in an easy and amusing way. I am really fascinated by how easy to build modern front-end application by using React and Redux.

The Demo is available at https://would-you-rather.wexort.com


To run the project in local machine:

* install all project dependencies with `yarn install`
* start the development server with `yarn start`
